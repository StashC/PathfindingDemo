An interactive pathfinding simulation implementing the A* pathfinding algorithm.  The simulation will find the shortest path between two points.  The user can select a start and end point, place barriers, or even have a maze generate for them.  Mazes are generated using a Depth First search algorithm, which I created after researching maze generating algorithms on wikipedia.  I was inspired by Sebastian Lague's youtube demo of Astar, and other pathfinding algorithms, so I decided to challenge myself and create one in Unity.
